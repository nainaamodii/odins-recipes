        <p>Cheesy Zucchini Casserole is a deliciously comforting dish that's perfect for using up fresh summer zucchini. Sliced zucchini is layered with rich, melty cheese—like cheddar or mozzarella—and baked with a creamy mixture of eggs and seasonings. A crispy topping of breadcrumbs or crushed crackers adds the perfect crunch. This casserole is easy to prepare and makes a great vegetarian main or hearty side dish. It's flavorful, cheesy, and satisfying enough to please the whole family. Serve it with a light salad or grilled protein for a balanced meal. It's a great way to turn simple vegetables into something special.</p>
